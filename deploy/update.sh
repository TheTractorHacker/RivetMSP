# RivetMSP — safe update wrapper around scripts/update_cli.php.
#
# This script does NOT reimplement update_cli.php's git-pull / migration
# logic — it orchestrates it safely: take a backup first (or make the
# operator explicitly opt out), run the update as the file-owning user
# update_cli.php itself requires, run the DB migrations, refresh composer
# deps, and reload php-fpm so opcache never keeps serving pre-update bytecode.
#
# Usage:
#   update.sh --app-dir=<path> [--passphrase-file=<path>] [--no-backup-confirmed] [--unattended]
#   update.sh --help
#
# Required:
#   --app-dir=<path>            Webroot of the instance to update.
#
# Backup (exactly one of these two must apply — see main() below):
#   --passphrase-file=<path>    Runs deploy/backup.sh with this passphrase
#                               file before touching anything. The whole
#                               update aborts if that backup fails — this
#                               script never updates an instance without a
#                               fresh, successful backup unless told to.
#   --no-backup-confirmed       Explicit, required opt-out when you are not
#                               providing --passphrase-file. Without EITHER
#                               flag, this script refuses to run at all.
#
# Options:
#   --unattended                 Cron-friendly mode: see setup_logging()
#                               below for exactly what this changes.
#   --help                       Show this help and exit.
#
# Must be run as root — reloading php-fpm requires it, and update_cli.php's
# own steps are then run via `sudo -u <owner-of-update_cli.php>` internally,
# matching that script's own file-owner enforcement
# (posix_geteuid() === fileowner(__FILE__)).
#
# Deliberately uses plain `--update` (a git pull), never `--force_update`
# (`git fetch --all && git reset --hard origin/master`) — a hard reset in an
# automated wrapper would silently discard any local edit an operator made
# directly on the box, which a git pull instead merges or fails loudly on.

RivetMSP — safe update wrapper

Usage:
  sudo deploy/update.sh --app-dir=<path> [options]

Required:
  --app-dir=<path>            Webroot of the instance to update.

Backup (pass exactly one; the script refuses to run with neither):
  --passphrase-file=<path>    Take a backup (via deploy/backup.sh) before
                              updating. Aborts the whole update if the
                              backup fails.
  --no-backup-confirmed       Explicitly proceed WITHOUT taking a backup
                              first. Only use this if you already have a
                              recent backup from elsewhere.

Options:
  --unattended                 Cron-friendly: output goes to
                              /var/log/itflow-update.log only, not the
                              terminal (there usually isn't one). Without
                              this flag, output goes to both.
  --help                       Show this help and exit.

Steps performed, in order: pre-update backup (or confirmed skip) -> git
pull via scripts/update_cli.php --update (run as that file's owner) ->
database migrations via scripts/update_cli.php --update_db -> composer
install (if composer.json exists) -> php8.4-fpm reload.
