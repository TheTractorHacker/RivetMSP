# RivetMSP — single-instance encrypted backup.
#
# Dumps one instance's database (mysqldump), its uploads/ directory
# (user-uploaded contracts/documents/tickets/etc — the content that isn't
# reproducible by re-cloning the git repo), and a small backup-manifest.json
# (installation_id + a fingerprint of config_settings_enc_key; the key itself
# is written to a SEPARATE 0600 file next to the archive, see do_backup()
# below), bundles all of it into one archive, encrypts it, and enforces a
# retention window on old encrypted backups. See deploy/restore.sh for the
# matching restore path.
#
# Meant to be driven by deploy/templates/itflow-backup.{service,timer} (a
# daily systemd timer) or root's own crontab — see this script's own
# argument parsing below for exactly what it needs. It is also called
# directly by deploy/update.sh as the mandatory pre-update backup step.
#
# Usage:
#   backup.sh --app-dir=<path> --passphrase-file=<path> [options]
#   backup.sh --help
#
# Required:
#   --app-dir=<path>            Webroot of the ITFlow instance to back up
#                               (the directory containing config.php).
#   --passphrase-file=<path>    Path to a 600-permission file holding the
#                               encryption passphrase. REQUIRED — this script
#                               refuses to run without it rather than ever
#                               silently writing an unencrypted dump to disk.
#                               The database dump contains password hashes
#                               and this app's own encrypted-but-still-
#                               sensitive credential vault ciphertexts, so an
#                               unencrypted backup is a real exposure, not a
#                               theoretical one.
#
# Options:
#   --retention-days=<N>        Delete encrypted backups older than N days
#                               from --dest. Default: 14.
#   --dest=<dir>                Where encrypted backups are written. Default:
#                               <app-dir>/backups (this directory is shared
#                               with the app's own built-in admin-panel
#                               backup feature, admin/post/backup.php, which
#                               writes its own unencrypted itflow_*.zip dumps
#                               there under different names — this script
#                               only ever touches files matching its own
#                               backup-*.enc naming, so the two coexist
#                               without either deleting the other's files).
#
# Must be run as root (see require_root below): the final encrypted backup
# is deliberately chmod 600, owned root:root — NOT readable by www-data —
# since a webshell that somehow got code execution as www-data should not
# be able to read this instance's entire backup history. That means this
# script itself has to be run by something already running as root: root's
# own crontab, or (the recommended path) the itflow-backup.service systemd
# unit shipped in deploy/templates/, which runs as User=root.

RivetMSP — single-instance encrypted backup

Usage:
  sudo deploy/backup.sh --app-dir=<path> --passphrase-file=<path> [options]

Required:
  --app-dir=<path>           Webroot of the instance to back up (must
                              contain config.php).
  --passphrase-file=<path>   600-permission file holding the encryption
                              passphrase. Refused if missing or not locked
                              down to owner-only access.

Options:
  --retention-days=<N>       Delete encrypted backups older than N days
                              from --dest. Default: 14.
  --dest=<dir>                Directory encrypted backups are written to.
                              Default: <app-dir>/backups.
  --offsite[=<config>]        Also copy each archive (and its .sha256 checksum
                              file) off this machine and apply retention there
                              too. <config> defaults to /etc/itflow/offsite.conf
                              (template: deploy/etc/offsite.conf.example; rclone,
                              S3, SFTP or a mounted directory).
  --no-offsite                Skip the off-site copy even if /etc/itflow/offsite.conf
                              exists (without --offsite/--no-offsite, that file's
                              presence turns the off-site copy on).
  --offsite-retention-days=<N>  Retention for the off-site copies (default: the
                              config's OFFSITE_RETENTION_DAYS, else --retention-days).
  --help                      Show this help and exit.

Must be run as root. Every run's outcome (success + file size + duration,
or the specific failure) is logged to /var/log/itflow-backup.log.
