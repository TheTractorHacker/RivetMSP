This file documents all notable changes made to ITFlow.

## [Unreleased]

## [26.10.2] RivetMSP — fix: blank Update page before the database update

Fixes a blank **Administration > Update** page on a server that had pulled 26.10.1 but not yet run **Update Database**: the new release-channel setting did not exist yet and its lookup raised an error. The page now renders, shows the channel from the checked-out branch, and saving the channel before the database update says to run Update Database first. No database change.

## [26.10.1] RivetMSP — Release channel (Production / Beta), with everything in 26.10

This is the first tagged release since the 26.10 work below. Apply database migrations 2.6.58 to 2.6.65 with **Update Database** (take a backup first); it requires rivet-core 0.14.0 (already bundled in `vendor/`).

### Release channel: Production or Beta

- **Administration > Update has a Release channel switch.** Production follows the `master` branch (tested releases); Beta follows `beta` (early access, changes more often). Each server chooses its own. The update check, **Update App**, the force update and `scripts/update_cli.php` (and so `deploy/update.sh`) all follow the chosen channel and move the server onto its branch. This replaces the old fixed `$repo_branch` value in `config.php`, which a server could be left pointing at a retired branch.
- **A server never goes backwards.** Switching to a channel whose latest release is older than the code already running is refused with an explanation, because the database may already be newer than that code can read. A switch that would overwrite hand-edited files is refused and leaves them untouched.
- Existing servers keep following the branch they are on today (a server on `beta` starts as Beta, everything else as Production), so nothing moves by itself. Database migration 2.6.65 adds the setting; a fresh install gets it from `db.sql`.


## [26.10] RivetMSP — SLA pause, resolution time rules, compliance status, saved-view filters and RivetCore

Consolidates the entries that were listed as Unreleased after 26.05. Apply database migrations with **Update Database**.

### Customisable ticket view filters

- **Edit the filters a saved view uses.** The view's Edit dialog (and Save Current View) now has a filter form instead of a fixed query: show Open, Closed or All tickets or pick specific statuses (new statuses you create appear automatically), assigned to anyone / me / unassigned / a named agent, priority, on-site or remote, overdue or due today, board, category and tags. The dialog also describes in plain words what the view currently does. Renaming a view without touching the form leaves its filters alone.
- Only validated choices are stored (unknown ids and junk values are dropped), a view with several statuses or tags now highlights correctly when active, and shared views can still only be edited by those allowed to. No database change.

### SLA no longer breaches while waiting on someone

- **Waiting statuses pause the SLA clock.** A ticket set to Waiting on Customer, Employee or Vendor (or On Hold) is no longer shown as breached because of the wait. While paused the clock is frozen: it never drifts into "Breached", the time spent paused is added back to the due date when the ticket moves on, and a ticket that was already past due before it was paused stays breached.
- **You choose which statuses pause it.** Administration > Ticket Statuses has a new **Pauses the SLA clock** option on every status, in the create dialog and the edit dialog, and an SLA clock column in the list. A status created later can opt in the same way, so the setting follows your own statuses. Saving a status updates the open tickets already in it. An SLA policy's own pause list still works and adds to this.
- **Every way of changing status is covered.** Agent status change, kanban drag, the API (including agent replies that move a ticket to Waiting on Customer), automation rules, and a customer reply that ends the wait all start or stop the pause. Anything that slips through is repaired when the ticket is opened and by the scheduled job. Ticket list, dashboard, ticket page and escalation rules all agree.
- Contract-hour SLAs (no policy) now also add paused time back. Database migration 2.6.64 adds the option (fresh installs get it from `db.sql`) and turns it on for On Hold and every status starting with "Waiting", then pauses open tickets already waiting.

### Resolution time rules

- **Only resolved tickets count toward average resolution time.** An open ticket, one in an "Unresolved" status, or one that was reopened and not yet resolved again is left out of every average (dashboard tile, ticket reports, per-technician figures and the API).
- **Reopening restarts the clock.** The time to resolve a reopened ticket is measured from the moment it was reopened to when it is resolved again, not from the original creation date. Creation dates are never changed. Every way of reopening is covered: agent status change, kanban, the department portal and guest link, the CSAT low-rating auto-reopen, automation and scheduled reopen, and the API. Moving or re-saving a ticket that is already open does not reset anything.
- Resolution time now ends at the resolved date (older tickets closed without one use the close date), instead of the close date, so a ticket that sits resolved before auto-closing is not penalised. SLA targets and SLA breach tracking are unchanged.
- Database migration 2.6.63 adds `ticket_resolution_started_at`; a fresh install gets it from `db.sql`. Existing tickets keep a blank start, so their time still runs from creation.

### Compliance status

- **Administration > Compliance status.** A live view of how this installation measures up against common security controls, tagged to ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS and HIPAA, with a score per framework. Automatic checks cover multi-factor authentication (agents and administrators), administrator count, session lifetime, HTTPS-only, vault key, backups, API-key expiry, dormant agents, schema currency, audit recording and retention against the chosen preset.
- **Manual checklist with sign-off.** Thirteen things software cannot see (policy review, risk assessment, access review, restore test, incident-response test and so on). Record who reviewed, when, the next due date and a note; items show as current, due soon or overdue. Every review is kept (append-only).
- **Snapshots and auditor export.** Save a snapshot at any time (one is also saved automatically each month, and kept). Download a CSV or a printable report for the whole position or a single framework, from the live view or from any snapshot. Saving, recording and exporting are written to the audit trail.
- **Share a report on the portal.** On a saved snapshot, choose Share to publish it, with an optional message, for every client who can sign in to the portal. They see it under a Security menu item: framework scores, the title and result of each check, and the status and last-review date of each checklist item. Counts, account names, reviewer names, notes and settings values are never shared. Nothing is shown until an administrator publishes, a newer snapshot does not replace what is shared, and Stop sharing removes it. Publishing and unpublishing are audited. Database migration 2.6.60 adds the table; rivet-core 0.10.0.
- **NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 / CMMC Level 2** is a fifth framework: every check and checklist item that maps to it carries requirement numbers (indicative; CMMC Level 2 corresponds to the 110 requirements). Included in migration 2.6.61. rivet-core 0.12.0.
- **Compliance for customers.** Each client gets a Compliance tab: choose the standards that apply to them (ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST 800-171/CMMC), work through a 23-item checklist with sign-off, save snapshots, export CSV or a printable report, and share a snapshot with the client's portal users under Security (reduced view: scores and each item's title, status and last-review date; never reviewer names, notes or evidence). Clients only ever see their own report. An overview page (Organization > Client compliance) lists every client's score and overdue items. Migration 2.6.61 adds `subject_id` to the compliance tables and a `compliance_subjects` table.
- **NIST 800-171 / CMMC retention preset** (Settings > Compliance): a 365-day minimum. 800-171 requires audit logs to be retained but sets no number, so this is the common choice to define in your policy. rivet-core 0.14.0.
- Fixed: the "Application and database are up to date" check showed "Version information is unavailable" because the page does not load the version file; it now reads it itself.
- Security hardening: the ajax modal builds its shell with DOM APIs instead of HTML strings, the bulk-action link rewrite accepts only a plain same-origin path, the bundled Markdown converter escapes backslashes in links, and the plugins' symfony/http-foundation is updated to 7.4.x (advisory fix).
- Database migration 2.6.62 adds the responsibilities table (used by RivetIT; harmless here).
- This is a self-assessment aid, not a certification or an audit opinion; control references are indicative and should be confirmed against the current text of each standard.
- Database migration 2.6.59 adds the two tables (created by rivet-core's own migration runner); a fresh install gets them from `db.sql`. Upgraded to rivet-core 0.9.0.

### Compliance settings

- **Settings > Compliance.** Pick a retention preset (ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS or HIPAA) and set how long the audit trail and the activity logs are kept. A preset is a **minimum**: records are never deleted younger than it (365 days, or 6 years for HIPAA), even if a number is set lower, and the hourly cleanup enforces it, not just the form. 0 keeps records forever and is always allowed. A preset helps meet a retention requirement; it does not make an organization compliant on its own.
- **Audit recording switch.** The page also holds the switch for the audit trail; any preset keeps it on. Saving the page is recorded in the audit trail with the before and after values, including the change that turns auditing off.
- The audit trail has its own retention, separate from the activity logs, webhook delivery log and finished background jobs (default 365 days, which keeps more than before). Security > Log retention honours a preset's minimum too.
- Database migration 2.6.58 adds the two settings; a fresh install gets them from `db.sql`. Upgraded to rivet-core 0.8.0.

### security follow-ups, log retention, complete fresh installs

- **Request ids are server-assigned.** The audit trail used to store whatever `X-Request-ID` header a client sent; it now always records a server-generated id.
- **Log retention.** The nightly-ish `cron/cron.php` now also prunes RivetCore's tables (audit trail, webhook delivery log, finished integration jobs) at the existing "log retention" horizon, and a retention of 0 now means **keep everything**: before this, 0 deleted every log older than today.
- **A fresh install is now complete.** `db.sql` was a very old snapshot and was missing 39 tables that migrations create, plus their default SLA policy and saved views, so a fresh install lacked mailboxes, push endpoints and more. It is regenerated from a clean install plus every migration, and a fresh import is identical to an upgraded install. Migration 2.6.57 also adds `ticket_schedules` and `ticket_techs` (appointments and Outlook sync used them, but no migration ever created them; they only existed on servers where they had been added by hand, so this is a no-op there).
- Upgraded to rivet-core 0.7.1, which fixes a crash on a job's fifth failed attempt.

### RivetCore foundation (off by default)

RivetMSP now has a `src/` directory with PSR-4 autoloading (`RivetMSP\`) and consumes **RivetCore**
(`rivet/rivet-core`, a tagged shared package also used by RivetIT). First module: the structured audit trail. Login
events (success, failed, blocked, MFA failed) can be written to a new append-only `audit_events` table, **only when
`settings.config_core_audit_enabled = 1`; it defaults to 0**, and a Composer update never turns it on. It cannot break
sign-in: any failure is swallowed. Database migration 2.6.55 adds the flag and runs RivetCore's own migration runner
(state in `rivet_core_migrations`, independent of this database version), and is skipped, to retry later, if the package
is not installed yet. Storage goes through a Core-owned `DatabaseInterface`; RivetMSP's implementation reuses the
existing mysqli connection. Tests are in `tests/core/`. MySQL/MariaDB is unchanged.

More RivetCore modules are wired, every one **off by default** with its own switch in `settings` (`config_core_<module>_enabled`):
Redis (locks, rate limiter, cron guard), Jobs (queue), ITSM (problems and changes), Webhooks (synchronous delivery with signed bodies;
the `X-ITFlow-*` and `X-RivetMSP-*` headers), Workflow, Automation (rule matching) and a health endpoint (`health/live.php` always on,
`health/ready.php` returns 404 until its switch is on). Nothing calls them yet, and a Composer update never turns one on. Migration 2.6.56
adds the switches, RivetCore's tables (created by Core's own runner) and one additive nullable column, `tickets.ticket_problem_id`, which links
incidents to problems. `db.sql` carries the same objects, and a fresh install and an upgraded install were compared table by table and are identical.
Remote MCP is not wired here: it needs agent single sign-on columns RivetMSP does not have yet.
