/*
 * ###############################################################################################################
 *  METRICS ROLLUP  (cron/metrics_rollup.php)
 * ###############################################################################################################
 *
 *  Upserts a per-day ticket-flow snapshot into ticket_metrics_daily so dashboards/reports can serve the
 *  "opened vs resolved vs backlog" trend from one indexed row per day instead of many live COUNT queries.
 *
 *  Recomputes YESTERDAY and TODAY on every run (idempotent via the UNIQUE(company_id, metric_date) key):
 *  yesterday's numbers stabilise once the day is over, today's keeps refreshing as tickets move.
 *
 *  Included daily from cron/cron.php. Also runnable stand-alone from the CLI for backfill/testing:
 *      php cron/metrics_rollup.php
 *
 *  ITFlow is single-company per install, so company_id is fixed at 1 (tickets carry no company_id column).
