/*
 * crm_reminders.php - CRM Engagement follow-up reminder worker
 *
 * Finds crm_activities whose reminder time has passed, that are not completed
 * and not yet reminded, and creates an in-app notification for the activity
 * owner (falling back to all admins when no owner is set). Each processed row
 * is stamped activity_reminded_at so it only ever fires once.
 *
 * WIRING: required from cron/cron.php on its normal hourly cadence.
 * It is also runnable standalone from the CLI:  php cron/crm_reminders.php
 * The bootstrap below only loads config/functions when they are not already
 * present, so it is safe to require_once from cron.php after its bootstrap.
