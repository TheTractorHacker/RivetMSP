 * Puts the module's `rmm.*` events (RivetCore 1.0.0-rc.9, RmmEventsInterface) on RivetMSP's event bus (includes/event_bus.php): one queued, signed
 * webhook delivery per subscribed endpoint, and every enabled event rule (Administration > Event rules) that matches. The module calls this AFTER
 * the change that caused the event has been committed and swallows anything thrown here; rivetEmitEvent() never throws anyway.
 *
 * The bus works on the global connection, so a module built over another connection (a test, a worker) is pointed at its own for the duration of
 * the call and put back afterwards.
